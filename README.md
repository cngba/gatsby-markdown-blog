# Gatsby Blog
This minimal blog is built with Gatsby JS and content-fed by Markdown. 
This is too minimal, seriously. Please consider [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) for your related projects.

## Features:
- Simple UI
- Only readable on larger screen (in other words, not yet responsive)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

```sh
npx gatsby new gatsby-markdown-blog https://github.com/cngba/gatsby-markdown-blog
```

### 2. **Navigate to your new project.**

```sh
cd gatsby-markdown-blog
```

### 3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Start the site by running `npm run develop`.

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
